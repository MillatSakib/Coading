Here we learn about Object oriented paradyme.

There are 4 piller of object oriented paradyme.They are 
(i) Abstruction (A)
(ii) Encapsulation (I)
(iii) Inheritence. (I)
(iv) Polimorphism.(P)
For take it remember we can Use a sortform AEIP. At First we have to know how a object oriented paradyme are work.
In OOP all the thing think like an object. If one thing have more than one charecteristic then we called it object.
Like: Man
A man has a name, has height, age etc. So we can tell a man as a object.

Now we will know about another thing oop which are use frequently. That is class. Class is blueprint of an Object.In functional programming we use function for solve a problem. But in OOP we use class to solve a problem.

Now we should know about the 4 piller of object oriented paradyme.

So let's go to a simple Brif of object oriented paradyme.

Abstruction: Abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.In the other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one. By using abstruction we are hiding the implementation details and  we are showing only the functionality to the user.. Like when we ride a car we donot know about the engine or gear system. These are hiding from us. This is one kind of Abstruction in our real life.

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is the process of hiding data form outside world.Like we donot want to show salary, then we have to use Encapsulation. In another language like c++ or java we use private keyword for Encapsulation. But in javascript there have no private keyword.

Inheritence: Inheritence is a machanism that allows us to create new classes based on an existing class.By using Inheritence we can reuse can existing code without repeating a code.

Polimorphism: Polymorphism means different forms. In Object oriented programming we can write methode with same name but different implementation.Like we can pass two or three value for summission. then we have to use Polimorphism.
