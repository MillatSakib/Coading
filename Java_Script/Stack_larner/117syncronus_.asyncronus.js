/*


JavaScript is both synchronous and asynchronous. It is a single-threaded language, which means that only one operation can be executed at a time. However, it also has a non-blocking event loop, which allows it to execute asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

Synchronous code is code that executes in the order in which it is written. Asynchronous code is code that can execute out of order.

// Synchronous example

console.log("Start");
// This function will block the main thread until it completes
function longRunningOperation() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
        // Do something
    }
}
longRunningOperation();
console.log("End");

// Output:

// Start
// End

/*

In this example, the longRunningOperation() function will block the main thread until it completes. This means that the console.log("End"); statement will not be executed until the longRunningOperation() function has finished running.

*/


//Asynchronous example

console.log("Start");
// This function will not block the main thread
function asyncLongRunningOperation() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
        // Do something
    }
    // Schedule the callback function to be executed when the async operation completes
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Async operation complete");
    }, 0);
}
asyncLongRunningOperation();
console.log("End");

// Output:

// Start
// End
// Async operation complete



/*

In this example, the asyncLongRunningOperation() function will not block the main thread. This means that the console.log("End"); statement will be executed immediately, even though the asyncLongRunningOperation() function has not finished running yet.

When the asyncLongRunningOperation() function completes, it will schedule the callback function to be executed. The callback function will then be executed by the event loop when it is ready.

Why is JavaScript asynchronous?

JavaScript is asynchronous because it is used to develop web applications. Web applications are often interactive and need to be able to respond to user input and events quickly. If JavaScript was synchronous, then it would block the main thread every time it had to perform a long-running operation, such as making a network request. This would make the web application unresponsive and frustrating for the user.

How to use asynchronous programming in JavaScript

There are a number of ways to use asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Some common methods include:

Callbacks: Callbacks are functions that are passed to other functions as arguments. When the other function completes, it calls the callback function.
Promises: Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
Async/await: Async/await is a syntax that makes it easier to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style.
Conclusion

JavaScript is a both synchronous and asynchronous language. This gives it the flexibility to be used for a wide variety of tasks, including developing interactive web applications.
